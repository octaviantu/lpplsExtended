# Execute

To fetch all the latest data and plot the bubbles:

```
python update_and_check_bubbles.py
```


# Development 

Format the code:
```
python setup.py format
```

To debug, check the configurations in `launch.json` and the files under '/lppls/demo'


# Other notes 

The Jupyter code and `lppls_cmaes` are from the repository I've forked.
They don't work.
